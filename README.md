# ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's Game Of Life | Visual Studio C++ Console Project

It is a zero player game, where evolution is determined only by the initial state and governed by few simple sets of instructions.

Here the rules are:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Developed over 15 iterations (from v0.8 to v2.5), it's a robust piece of code on which you can test your aggression. Any random stroke on the keyboard can't hang this program. 

It can be controlled using traditional arrow keys on the keyboard and has a proper UI interface.

You can create, save, and continue previous patterns and even change the colours. You can choose between any solid colour or just random colours per cell.

To open the game, go to the respective game version folder and open the .sln file in Visual Studio, else, again go to the Game Of Life vXXX folder and locate the .cpp file and other .dat files.
